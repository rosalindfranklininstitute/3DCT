Developer notes

Use the Anaconda environment RFI-3DCT in file rfi-3dct-condaenvironment.yml

In a Anaconda command prompt type
conda env create -f rfi-3dct-condaenvironment.yml

Before trying the TDCT-main.py, the other package tools3dct must be installed first.
This is not a conda package, it is a git python package.

https://github.com/rosalindfranklininstitute/tools3dct
and install it (in your appropriate conda environment) using

>python setup.py install

Problems:

For some strange reason it installs:
- PyQt5, even though is already installed in the conda environment
conda list, shows pyqt5

- tools3dct setup.py installs pyqt5 and pyqt5-qt5

- imageio 2.9, even though it is already installed in conda environment.

Moved tools3dct to this project
(please note that there is other stuff in the tools3dct that may be useful, such as the analysis routines)


Creation of the executable file is working, file runs but nothing happens. Can't debug.
Try changing all packages to conda-forge
 
To debug, create installer without --windowed flag
pyinstaller TDCT_main.py --name "3DCorrelationToolbox-RFI" -i "icons\3DCT_icon.ico" --hidden-import="skimage.filters.rank.core_cy_3d" --add-data "TDCT_correlation.ui;." --add-data "TDCT_main.ui;." --add-data "icons_rc.py;."

Getting pyinstaller errors when trying to execute the file
IMPORTANT - Install (pyinstaller AND) PyQt5 using pip instead of conda

pip install pyqt5
(conda has no pyqt5 but has pyqt, but it does not work with pyinstaller)

Otherwise, you may get the error:
AttributeError: Module 'PyQt5' has no attribute '__version__'

Added Reikna GPU deconvolution. Works well in Visual Studio Code (running from command line under conda)
But pyinstaller executable does not succeed in using GPU.
It appears that the RedLionfish package is not being included with the 3DCT software
TODO: Run tests, create pyinstaller packages outside 3DCT.
Result: 
[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'C:\\Users\\Luis\\Desktop\\3DCT-RFI-git\\dist\\3DCorrelationToolbox-RFI\\reikna\\cluda\\kernel.mako'     

TODO: Include the *.mako files in the spec or in the --add
